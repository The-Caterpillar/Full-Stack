// Two types of memory allocation:   1. STACK   &   2. HEAP

/* Stack (Primitive data types) - stores primitive values (String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt) in a simple and linear way.
   Heap (Reference data types) - stores complex data structures (Object, Array, Function) in a more dynamic way.
